#About
This is a game developed by our team - Comically Long UnicoRn.

Our team is built by 9 people who love gaming and this is the first game we made, ever.

The theme of the Game Jam was "Bubbles" and with that, we created our game - "Baba Boba".

This is a shop management game were we run a Boba drink shop where each time, a customer will come, and ask for a specific drink (with the option of a Tapioca topping).

the player can grab the cup place it on the machine, and add the liquid and toppings he/she sees fit, and the customer will respond.

The main Achievement of the game is that it was developed in less than 48 hours. It took the hard work of everyone on the Team.
