This is a game developed by our team - Comically Long UnicoRn.<br>
Our team is built by 9 people who love gaming and this is the first game we made, ever.<br>
The theme of the Game Jam was "Bubbles" and with that, we created our game - "Baba Boba".<br>
The main Achievement of the game is that it was developed in less than 48 hours. It took the hard work of everyone on the Team.<br>

## Game Mechanics
This is a shop management game where we run a Boba drink shop where each time, a customer will come, and ask for a specific drink (with the option of a Tapioca topping).<br>
the player can grab the cup place it on the machine, and add the liquid and toppings he/she sees fit, and the customer will respond.<br>
